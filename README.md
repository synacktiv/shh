Automatic [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service hardening guided by [strace](https://strace.io/) profiling.

See [this article](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/systemd-hardening-made-easy-with-shh) for an introduction.

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) - [Currently supported systemd options](systemd_options.md)

## Installation

### Dependencies

Strace needs to be installed and available in the path. Strace version >=6.4 is strongly recommended.

### From source

You need a Rust build environment for example from [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Run in the current repository:

```
cargo build --release
install -Dm 755 -t /usr/local/bin target/release/shh
```

or from `crates.io`:

```
sudo cargo install --root /usr/local
```

### Debian (or Debian based distribution)

See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/desbma/shh/releases) for Debian packages built for each tagged version.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install the [shh AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shh).

## Usage

To harden a system unit named `SERVICE.service`:

1. Start service profiling: `shh service start-profile SERVICE`. The service will be restarted with strace profiling.
2. Use the service normally for a while, trying to cover as much features and use cases as possible.
3. Run `shh service finish-profile SERVICE -a`. The service will be restarted with a hardened configuration built from previous runtime profiling, to allow it to run safely as was observed during the profiling period, and to deny other dangerous system actions.

Run `shh -h` for full command line reference, or append `-h` to a subcommand to get help.

Services running in per-user instances of the service manager (controlled via `systemctl --user ...`) are **not** supported.

> [!WARNING]
> The hardening options generated by `shh` are by construction **not** portable across different systems.
> They depend on many factors, and may break the service if any of those change:
>
> - the code path covered during profiling
> - the Linux kernel version
> - the libc used
> - the systemd version
>
> Reusing options generated by `shh` on a system with a different environment (ie. different Linux distribution) is very likely to break the service.
